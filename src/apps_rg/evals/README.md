# Apps RG evaluation contracts

`apps_rg/evals` evaluates sealed Apps RG artifacts. It does not launch the
resume-generation runtime, change retrieval, or authorize a release merely by
producing a score.

The versioned measurement contract is
[`contracts/evaluation_contract.v2.yaml`](contracts/evaluation_contract.v2.yaml).
It keeps six evaluation questions independent:

| Gate | Question | Current implementation state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 - Retrieval | Did the graph retrieve the most relevant available evidence? | Active; legacy W6 metrics are preserved and the finite-universe API adds coverage, hard-negative, and slice results. |
| G2 - Binding | Was evidence bound to the correct employer, role, date, metric, credential, and graph path? | Active; the claim-evidence API verifies seven exact binding dimensions and graph paths. |
| G3 - Grounding | Is every material generated claim supported by exact cited evidence? | Active; the material-claim API recomputes support and fails closed on incomplete evidence. |
| G4 - Output quality | Is the resume relevant, natural, concise, credible, ATS-compatible, and personalized? | Active; five section lanes plus sealed whole-resume and six-pair W9 evaluation are implemented. |
| G5 - Robustness | Is behavior acceptable across stored runs and difficult evidence scenarios? | Active; eleven governed scenarios require at least three distinct sealed execution receipts and separate decision stability from prose variation. |
| G6 - Eval validity | Do the graders catch known defects without rejecting clean controls? | Active for machine-critical G1/G2/G3 graders; authorized human/judge agreement remains explicitly unmeasured pending a real pilot. |

## Result semantics

Every gate emits exactly one state:

- `PASS`: all required evidence exists and the gate's governed criteria pass.
- `FAIL`: sufficient evidence exists and at least one governed criterion fails.
- `UNKNOWN`: the gate should be measurable, but required evidence is missing,
  invalid, untrusted, or insufficient.
- `NOT_MEASURED`: the gate is outside the declared measurement coverage of the
  report or has no implemented measurement lane.

Missing evidence never becomes `PASS`. `UNKNOWN` is distinct from
`NOT_MEASURED`, and neither state is release-authorizing.

## Score groups

Reports use the following named groups without calculating a blended overall
score:

- `retrieval_quality`
- `binding_accuracy`
- `factual_grounding`
- `section_quality`
- `whole_resume_quality`
- `runtime_repeatability`
- `evaluator_validity`

The report schemas require all six gates and all seven score groups to be
present. An unavailable lane is represented explicitly as `UNKNOWN` or
`NOT_MEASURED`; it is not omitted.

## Authority boundary

This contract is declarative. It does not change the existing W6 authority,
the six-pair W9 prerequisite contract, current-run release authority, or the
future-run-only threshold-promotion rule. Model judges remain advisory until
calibrated against authorized human review. The existing
`resume_graph_evaluation.py` and `c03_w9_closeout.py` entry points retain their
current behavior. `c03_ci_ratchet.py` retains its legacy JUnit-only API and can
additionally fail closed over seven normalized sealed score-group receipts.

Schemas:

- [`schemas/evaluation_gate_result.v1.schema.json`](schemas/evaluation_gate_result.v1.schema.json)
  defines one named gate result.
- [`schemas/evaluation_report.v2.schema.json`](schemas/evaluation_report.v2.schema.json)
  defines a complete, non-blended report over G1-G6.
- [`schemas/claim_evidence_record.v1.schema.json`](schemas/claim_evidence_record.v1.schema.json)
  freezes one material claim, exact locator, path, entailment, and factual
  bindings. Additional runtime-authored support flags are rejected.
- [`schemas/retrieval_universe.v1.schema.json`](schemas/retrieval_universe.v1.schema.json)
  freezes one query and every candidate in its finite labelled universe.
- [`schemas/ci_gate_receipt.v1.schema.json`](schemas/ci_gate_receipt.v1.schema.json)
  defines the normalized sealed score-group boundary consumed by the CI
  ratchet.

## Grounding, binding, and retrieval APIs

`apps_rg.evals.resume_graph` exports the Wave 3 entry points:

- `seal_claim_evidence_record` and `evaluate_claim_evidence` operate on one
  claim-evidence record. `evaluate_binding_gate` and `evaluate_grounding_gate`
  emit independent G2 and G3 dispositions over the same complete denominator.
- `seal_retrieval_query` freezes the candidate denominator.
  `evaluate_retrieval_query` preserves Recall and nDCG at 1, 3, 5, and 10,
  adds coverage and hard-negative metrics, and never evaluates only emitted
  Top-K. `evaluate_retrieval_gate` requires distinct calibration and holdout
  sets and reports governed slices.

The deterministic rubrics live in
[`contracts/grounding_binding_rubric.v1.yaml`](contracts/grounding_binding_rubric.v1.yaml)
and
[`contracts/retrieval_coverage_rubric.v1.yaml`](contracts/retrieval_coverage_rubric.v1.yaml).
They are future-run-only measurement rules; they do not promote thresholds or
change W6 release authority.

## Section quality benchmark

[`section_quality_benchmark/`](section_quality_benchmark/) provides the active
five-lane offline G4 section evaluator. It consumes sealed artifacts and
completed absolute or blinded pairwise reviews, keeps human and model-judge
results separate, and emits no runtime or release authority. Whole-resume and
W9 scoring remain outside this section benchmark and are measured separately
below.

## Whole-resume and W9 evaluation

[`whole_resume/`](whole_resume/) calculates substantive whole-resume metrics and
the three governed human no-worse decisions over exactly six blinded W9 pairs.
Its sealed receipt feeds the existing `c03_w9_closeout.py` prerequisite checker;
neither component launches the runtime or changes current-run release authority.

## Stored-run robustness

[`repeatability/`](repeatability/) implements G5 over already-completed sealed
runs. It never launches Apps RG. The governed registry covers rich and sparse
evidence, ambiguity, binding collisions, unsupported requests, prompt
injection, inflation requests, and legitimate omission. At least three
distinct execution identities and receipt digests are required per scenario;
copying a run directory cannot satisfy independence. Evidence, bindings,
grounding, dispositions, semantic section decisions, quality scores, and raw
wording variation are reported separately. Any critical grounding or final
disposition divergence fails.

## Evaluator validity and CI ratchet

[`meta_eval/`](meta_eval/) implements the machine-critical part of G6 by
running the real G1/G2/G3 graders against clean controls and controlled defects.
It covers hard-negative promotion, relevant evidence outside Top-K,
calibration/holdout leakage, exact-binding mutations, unsupported entailment,
source removal, digest tampering, and wrong graph paths. Critical grounding and
provenance mutation recall must be 1.0 and clean-control false-positive rate
must be at most 0.05. Human-grader, judge-human, reviewer, and adjudication
agreement remain `null` until an authorized pilot; the receipt cannot freeze
those thresholds or authorize release.

The optional sealed-receipt mode in `c03_ci_ratchet.py` requires exactly the
seven named score groups and validates each digest, status, baseline signature,
and governed failure counter. Missing receipts, invalid digests, required
`UNKNOWN`, critical regression, unsupported material claims, holdout leakage,
mutation failures, and unexpected baseline signatures fail the ratchet. This
is an evaluator-owned aggregation surface only; workflow files are unchanged.
