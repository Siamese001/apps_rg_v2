# X1D LLM Judge Provider Configuration

`apps_rg/config/provider_profiles.yaml` is the only SSOT for apps_rg X1D judge
model selection and judge runtime limits. The lane-calibrated retry/token table
lives under `runtime_limits.judge.runtime_profiles` in that file. This document
intentionally does not duplicate model IDs, model override env vars, retry
counts, token budgets, or fallback instructions.

Runtime code resolves judge models through
`apps_rg.runtime.judges.section_judge_profile.resolve_section_proof_judge_model`.
Credentials and provider endpoints may still come from environment variables,
but environment variables must not select judge models or LLM runtime policy.

If a configured provider model is unavailable, the run blocks and records the
provider error in artifacts. It does not switch to another model.
