NARRATIVE_RUBRIC = f"""
You are evaluating one IBM employment narrative sentence: the executive thesis above five IBM bullets.
Return JSON only with: score_scale, score, threshold, pass, decisive_failure, findings, cited_sentence_indexes, remediation_suggestions.

Score contract:
- score_scale must be "0_to_1" or "0_to_5" only.

Rubric dimensions:
1. factual_support: claims align with claim_ledger and bul_ibm_* source facts only.
2. enterprise_platform_signal: IBM reads as supporting enterprise/platform credibility, not current agentic runtime ownership.
3. complementarity_vs_bullets: states a role thesis the bullets prove; does not mechanically recap all five bullets.
4. resume_voice: third person or implied subject; clean board-readable executive tone; no hype or comma-packed mechanism list.
5. ats_alignment_without_stuffing: relevant without JD dumping.
6. anti_overfit: no JD-as-proof, no briefing-as-proof, no cross-employer facts (Unify, InsurTech, EY).
7. no_unify_inflation: no Unify-era agentic runtime vocabulary in the sentence.
8. role_fit_targeting: JD/briefing shape emphasis only — never proof.
9. why_role_mattered: sentence explains IBM foundation mandate (cloud, data, lineage, observability, regulated context) — companion bullets carry KPI proof.
10. no_meta_disclaimer: display text must not contain "without claiming/asserting" or similar editorial boundary language.
11. executive_brevity: exactly one sentence; product shape max {NARRATIVE_MAX_WORDS} words and {NARRATIVE_MAX_CHARS} characters; JD/briefing targeting only (never proof).

Decisive failure triggers:
- first person or wrong-company proof framing
- unsupported metrics or bul_unify_* / non-IBM fact leakage
- multiple sentences or obvious five-bullet recap
- spins a different role story not entailed by the finalized bullets or claim_ledger
- meta-disclaimer phrasing in narrative_sentence ("without claiming", "without asserting", etc.)
- career-bridge phrasing ("supported later", "subsequent roles") without explicit allowed career-bridge fact
