"""Hatch helpers for mocked judges in section dispatch CLIs (plumbing-only path).

Generation provider is always ``external_model`` (offline contract tests use
``APPS_RG_PROVIDER_MODEL_OFFLINE_CONTRACT_STUB=1`` — emits ``OFFLINE_CONTRACT_STUB`` transport status).

Keeps deterministic exit codes + proof-field wiring shared across headline, competencies,
IBM bullets/narrative, unify narrative/bullets (legacy ``-m``), and orchestration harnesses."""
