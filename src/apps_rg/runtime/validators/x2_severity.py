"""X2 gate severity SSOT — Claude Sonnet 5 base recalibration (plan x2-gate-slimdown-b4e8d2).

A small, central lever to demote adversarially-verified STYLE gates from hard-FAIL to WARN
WITHOUT touching their detection logic. A demoted gate still runs and computes its real verdict;
``soften_warn_only`` flips a *failing* result for a demoted gate to ``pass=True`` and stamps
``WARN_ONLY_MARKER`` into ``failure_reason`` so the demotion stays honest, auditable, and reversible
(remove the id from ``STYLE_WARN_GATE_IDS`` → it is a hard FAIL again).

Applied at the lane gate-assembly seam (``soften_warn_only(run_<lane>_x2_gates(...))``), so every
downstream consumer — the per-lane ``product_quality_status`` ("all x2 pass") AND the shared
``aggregate_x3`` ``failed_gates`` computation AND the product-shape "required gates passed" check —
all observe the softened (passed) result. The raw ``run_<lane>_x2_gates`` functions are untouched,
so the ``weak_fail_cases`` unit suite still exercises real detection and acts as a tripwire: if a
CORRECTNESS gate were ever mis-added here, that raw-detection test would flip and fail.

INVARIANT (constitutional — do not weaken a gate to make a bad output pass): only gates that
survived adversarial refutation in workflow ``x2-gate-triage`` (CONFIRM verdict) appear here. NEVER
add a CORRECTNESS gate (grounding / cross-employer or cross-section leakage / fabrication /
metric-fidelity / schema-count / REAL_LLM / graph-skill binding). See plans/x2-gate-slimdown-b4e8d2.md.
