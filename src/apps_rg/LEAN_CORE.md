## Purpose

This document establishes the architectural binding law for apps_rg as part of the Lean-Core Spine Contract Binding + Authority Collapse refactor. It defines what apps_rg owns, what it does not own, and the rules for binding to the spine contract layer.

---

## Mental Model

### BAD BINDING (Deprecated)
```
apps_rg is hard-wired to agentic_core imports and concrete implementation internals.
```

### GOOD BINDING (Target)
```
apps_rg is bound to the spine contract.

agentic_core is one runtime implementation of the spine.
apps_rg speaks the spine contract cleanly.
apps_rg does not become a sub-platform or reimplement the spine.
```

---

## Binding Law

### 1. apps_rg binds to spine contracts, not agentic_core implementation.

All production imports of spine functionality must route through `apps_rg.runtime.spine_contracts`. Concrete agentic_core runtime internals are **FORBIDDEN** in production code.

**Allowed:**
```python
from apps_rg.runtime.spine_contracts import ValidatedRequest, RouteContract
```

**Forbidden:**
```python
from agentic_core.runtime.entrypoints.integrated_single_action_spine_run import ...
from agentic_core.runtime.judges.panel import ...
from agentic_core.L2_execution import ...
```

**Temporary Exception:**
- `apps_rg/runtime/spine_contracts.py` may re-export existing contract classes while contracts still live under agentic_core.
- No other apps_rg production module may import those contract classes directly.

**Long-term Target:**
Neutral shared contract package (e.g., `apps_shared/spine_contracts` or `agentic_spine_contracts`) that both apps_rg and agentic_core depend on.

---

### 2. Graph is mandatory for apps_rg product value.

- C0.3 graph context must be emitted for all active generation routes
- Graph traversal policy must be present in route contracts
- Graph skills proof pool must be active for relevant sections
- Role-family projection uses graph topology
- Phase changes use graph-traversal reasoning

**Non-Negotiable:** Graph capabilities are not optional. They are core to apps_rg's value proposition.

---

### 3. Sections remain independently runnable.

- Section CLI entrypoints must function without full-run orchestration
- Section debugging capability is preserved
- SectionRunner consolidates lifecycle, not eliminates independent execution
- Each section can be generated, validated, and debugged in isolation

---

### 4. Candidate facts prove claims.

- No JD or briefing text may be used as candidate claim proof
- All claims must reference verified fact IDs from candidate graph
- Fact IDs are validated against candidate_facts graph
- Claims without supporting facts are flagged, not silently accepted

**Product Rule:** If a claim cannot be traced to a candidate fact ID, it is marked as unsupported.

---

### 5. Graph supports role/phase/skill routing unless fact-bound.

- Role-family projection uses graph topology
- Phase changes use graph-traversal reasoning
- Skills graph drives competency selection
- When facts are explicit, they override graph inference
- Graph never overrides explicit candidate facts

---

### 6. JD and briefing are targeting only.

- JD text informs positioning, never proves candidate claims
- Briefing informs strategic targeting, never proves candidate claims
- Both are inputs to the generation process, not evidence in the proof pool
- Claims sourced only from JD/briefing without fact support are rejected

---

### 7. One authority per decision.

| Stage | Authority | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| U0 | Structure Validation | Validate input structure, stamp identity, reject missing required inputs |
| L1 | Deterministic Planning | Plan generation without evidence retrieval, route hints are advisory only |
| L0 | Deterministic Routing | One cheapest safe route, no retrieval, no model call |
| C0 | Evidence Resolution | Candidate facts prove claims, graph supports routing unless fact-bound |
| PA | Prompt Assembly | One compiler, one artifact shape, canonical slot order |
| L2 | Model Execution | All model calls through ProviderGatewayPort |
| Exit | Disposition Aggregation | X1 checkout, X2 aggregation, X3 exactly one disposition |

**Rule:** No stage takes authority from another stage.

---

### 8. Missing briefing fails closed unless the governed Apps Research facade succeeds.

- Product delegation is permitted only through
  `apps_rg.integrations.apps_research_bridge`.
- The facade must enter Apps Research through its canonical U0 boundary and
  return an atomically committed handoff-v2 bundle.
- Apps RG U0 validates the persisted bundle bytes and retains its consumer
  validation receipt; caller-provided provenance flags cannot weaken this.
- A missing briefing with delegation disabled, or a failed/legacy-only
  delegation, is a product error. There is no local fallback brief generator.

**Active Generation Modes (require briefing):**
- strategic_tailor
- tailor_existing
- generate_scratch
- section_regen
- healing_fact_check

---

### 9. R1B semantic output reuse is opt-in only.

**Default:** OFF (R1B semantic cache disabled)

**Opt-in Activation:**
```bash
export APPS_RG_ENABLE_R1B_SEMANTIC_CACHE=1
```

**Rules:**
- R1B never bypasses graph validation unless explicitly enabled
- When enabled, R1B hit must still pass graph digest verification
- Exact deterministic cache (R1A) remains enabled by default

**Rationale:** Prevent semantic cache from bypassing graph-grounded career reasoning.

---

### 10. LLM judges evaluate compact packets only; they do not repair.

**JudgePacket Shape:**
```python
{
    "section_id": "...",
    "target_company": "...",
    "target_role": "...",
    "display_text": "...",
    "claim_ledger": [...],
    "fact_abstracts": [...],
    "deterministic_gate_summary": {...},
    "rubric_ref": "...",
    "rubric_compact": "8-12 checks max"
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Judge input target: 2k-4k tokens
- Judge output target: <500 tokens JSON
- Attempts: 1 (default)
- No full prompt, JD, briefing, or chat thread in judge context

**Deterministic X2 First:**
- Hard deterministic gates enforce correctness before judge
- Judge only runs after X2 gates pass
- Judge evaluates quality, not correctness

---

### 11. Exit emits exactly one X3 for product-visible full runs.

- Section dispositions map to same Exit model
- No section-local final authority bypass
- Full run emits one coherent X3 disposition
- Canonical X3 options are `X3A_DENY_REROUTE`,
  `X3B_ESCALATE_HITL`, `X3C_COMMIT_REQUEST_TO_UWG`,
  `X3D_ALLOW_FINISH`, and `X3E_SAFE_ABSTAIN`.
- Only exact `X3D_ALLOW_FINISH` authorizes a product-visible finished resume.
- Legacy aliases such as `ALLOW`, `X3C`, `X3D`, `EXIT_OK`, and
  `EXIT_PARTIAL` are not product-v2 success codes.
- UNKNOWN is never PASS

---

### 12. UWG alone writes durable state.

- No durable writes from L2, L3, judges, or apps_rg runtime
- All state changes route through UWG
- Exit may emit disposition, but UWG writes the record
- L4 storage is UWG-orchestrated

---

### 13. L6 remains post-run only.

- L6 cannot rescue the current run
- L6 operates on completed run artifacts only
- L6 is offline shadow calibration and learning
- L6 never mutates in-progress runs
- L6 outputs inform future runs, not current run

### 14. No placeholder type aliases in production facade.

- `spine_contracts.py` exports only verified contract symbols
- No `RejectedRequest = ValidatedRequest` aliases
- No `ExitReviewPacket = dict` workarounds
- If a symbol is needed but not found, request core addition or defer usage
- Placeholders create false type safety and brittle contracts

### 15. Import-boundary ratchet: inventory → block new → burn down.

- Phase A: Inventory all existing violations
- Phase B: CI guard blocks NEW violations (existing grandfathered)
- Phase C: Burn down existing violations per sprint plan
- Never add new forbidden imports to production code
- Migration tickets required for each existing violation

### 16. Contract-symbol verification before facade creation.

- All symbols in `spine_contracts.py` must be verified to exist in `agentic_core/runtime/contracts`
- Inventory generated before facade creation via `tools/apps_rg/inventory_contract_symbols.py`
- Symbol inventory stored at `artifacts/apps_rg/contract_symbol_inventory.json`
- Unverified symbols deferred until core addition or proper definition

---

## Product Ownership

### apps_rg OWNS (Product Logic)

- **Graph-grounded career arcs**: Resume narrative structured around career trajectory
- **Phase/role/skills graph projection**: Graph-driven role and phase mapping
- **Section specs**: Shape, constraints, validation rules per section
- **Proof-pool selection**: Which facts support which claims
- **JD/briefing targeting boundaries**: How targeting inputs inform (not prove) generation
- **Resume assembly**: Final resume composition from sections
- **Product-specific validators**: X2 validators for resume-specific correctness

### apps_rg does NOT OWN (Core Spine)

- Concrete agentic_core execution engines
- Core route engines
- Core L2 executors
- Core Exit pipelines
- UWG (Universal Write Guard)
- L4 (Storage Layer)
- L6 (Learning Layer - post-run only)
- Concrete core judge engines

## Import Architecture

### Production Code Import Rules

| From | To | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| `apps_rg/*` | `apps_rg.runtime.spine_contracts` | ALLOWED |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.contracts.*` | TEMPORARY (via facade only) |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.entrypoints.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.entry.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.L0_routing.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.L1_cognition.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.L2_execution.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.exit.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.judges.*` | **FORBIDDEN** (except via panel port) |
| `apps_rg/*` | `agentic_core.runtime.l6.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |
| `apps_rg/integrations/apps_research_bridge.py` | governed Apps Research facade | **ALLOWED** |
| all other `apps_rg/*` | `apps_research.*` | **FORBIDDEN** |

### Test Code Import Rules

Tests may import directly for mocking and integration testing, but should prefer:
- Test doubles that implement Protocol interfaces
- Mock facades that simulate contract behavior

---

## CI Enforcement

### test_apps_rg_spine_contract_binding.py

**Purpose:** Verify apps_rg production code has zero forbidden concrete agentic_core imports

**Trigger:** Every PR touching `apps_rg/`

**Behavior:**
- Walks all `apps_rg/*.py` files via AST
- Extracts import statements
- Fails if any forbidden import pattern matches

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- `agentic_core.runtime.entrypoints`
- `agentic_core.runtime.entry`
- `agentic_core.L0_routing`
- `agentic_core.L1_cognition`
- `agentic_core.L2_execution`
- `agentic_core.runtime.exit`
- `agentic_core.runtime.judges` (concrete)
- `agentic_core.runtime.l6`

**Exemptions:**
- `apps_rg/runtime/spine_contracts.py` (the facade itself)
- Test files (`tests/*`, `test_*.py`)
- Files explicitly listed in `EXEMPT_FILES`

**Failure Message:**
```
Forbidden concrete agentic_core imports detected:
  - apps_rg/runtime/orchestration.py: from agentic_core.runtime.entrypoints import ...

All production imports must route through apps_rg/runtime/spine_contracts.py
```

**Bypass:** `SPINE_CONTRACT_BINDING_BYPASS=1` (emergency only, requires CTO approval)

---

## Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Facade (Current)
- `spine_contracts.py` re-exports from `agentic_core.runtime.contracts`
- `ports.py` defines Protocol interfaces
- CI enforces import boundary

### Phase 2: Contract Package
- Extract `agentic_core.runtime.contracts` to `agentic_spine_contracts`
- Both `apps_rg` and `agentic_core` depend on `agentic_spine_contracts`
- Facade becomes pass-through or removed

### Phase 3: Runtime Port Injection
- `agentic_core` implements `SpineRuntimePort`, `ProviderGatewayPort`, etc.
- `apps_rg` receives port implementations via dependency injection
- No direct imports of concrete implementations

---

## Violations and Remediation

### Detecting Violations

```bash
# Run import boundary check
python -m pytest tests/architecture/test_apps_rg_spine_contract_binding.py -v

# Find current violations (before fix)
grep -r "from agentic_core.runtime" apps_rg --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v spine_contracts
```

### Remediation Process

1. Identify the forbidden import
2. Determine the contract type needed
3. Add to `spine_contracts.py` if missing
4. Change import to use facade
5. Run CI check to verify
6. Document in wave completion notes
