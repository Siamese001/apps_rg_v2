## What's Specifically Hard About This Domain

Good research is **latency-tolerant but quality-sensitive**. Users wait 30s gladly for cited, contradiction-aware output and reject 2s output that hallucinates. That sets a unique engineering bar:

1. **Citation rate is a quality SLO, not a target.** ≥95% of claims must have at least one source. The system halts render rather than ship uncited claims.
2. **Contradicting sources must be surfaced, not silenced.** If two sources disagree, the rendered output explicitly says so — the user, not the system, picks a side.
3. **Source confidence is bounded `[0,1]` and tracked.** A source the system finds but can't verify gets a low confidence score and is flagged in the output.
4. **Per-claim provenance** is a known gap (currently per-section); closing it is a NEXT_STEP. Good citation today; great citation when claim-level lands.

This drives the architecture: 32KB research assembly engine, 18KB source validator, contradiction-detection block in synthesis, retrieval engine with vector + web sources, citation-grounding pass.

## Non-Goals (deliberately out of scope)

- **Real-time information.** The system retrieves, but assumes the corpus is "recent enough" — sub-day freshness is not the goal.
- **Position-taking on contested claims.** When sources contradict, the system surfaces the contradiction; it does not pick a side.
- **Translation / localization.** Output language matches input.
- **Multi-modal output (charts, video).** Text + cited sources only.

## Alternatives Considered (and rejected)

### Alternative 1: Synthesize first, cite second
**Rejected:** post-hoc citation is hallucination's gateway drug. Sources must drive the synthesis, not justify it after the fact.

### Alternative 2: Single-source-per-claim policy
**Rejected:** single-source claims hide source disagreement. Multi-source surfaces contradictions, which is the point.

### Alternative 3: Auto-resolve contradicting sources by recency
**Rejected:** "newer is more right" is a heuristic, not truth. Surface the disagreement; let the user judge.

## Architectural Differentiation From Peer Apps

apps_research is the only app with **first-class contradiction handling** — sources that disagree are surfaced, not silenced. This is the ethical position that differentiates a research engine from a synthesizer.

apps_research is also the only app with **bounded source confidence** as a tracked dimension — every cited source has a confidence score in `[0,1]`, and low-confidence sources are flagged in the output.

The 32KB `research_assembly_engine.py` is the largest engine in the portfolio. Its size reflects the multi-stage pipeline: retrieve → validate → ground → synthesize → contradiction-detect → render. Each stage earns its place against a research-quality failure mode.

## SVP Standards Compliance

(Original review content preserved below for rubric mapping.)


apps_research has been hardened to SVP engineering quality standards, matching the rigor of apps_eval, apps_lic, apps_rg, and apps_rfp. This includes:

- **Strict Typing:** Pydantic models with Field validators and bounds checking
- **Explicit Validation:** Source credibility and claim type validation
- **Integration Adapters:** Execution and observability integration
- **Artifact Renderers:** JSON, Markdown, HTML output formats
- **Configuration:** YAML-based thresholds and policies
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 100% test pass rate

## SVP Standards Compliance

### 1. Domain Contracts (Pydantic)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ResearchConfig | ✅ | Configuration with bounds (max_sections, quality_score) |
| ResearchRequest | ✅ | Input contract with topic validation |
| ResearchResult | ✅ | Output contract with gate validation |
| ResearchRunSummary | ✅ | Summary with provenance |
| ResearchSection | ✅ | Body validation (min 50 chars) |
| SourceEntry | ✅ | Confidence bounds (0-1) |
| ComparisonRow | ✅ | Comparison matrix row |

### 2. Integration Adapters

| Adapter | Integration | Contract |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| ExecutionAdapter | Runtime execution | ExecutionRequest dataclass |
| ObservabilityAdapter | Metrics/observability | Structured events |

### 3. Output Renderers

| Renderer | Formats | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ResearchRenderer | JSON, Markdown, Compact | Full research output |
| ResearchSummaryRenderer | JSON, Markdown, Compact | Run summaries |
| SectionRenderer | JSON, Markdown, Compact, HTML | Individual sections |

### 4. Configuration

| Config File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| research_thresholds.yaml | Quality gate thresholds |
| research_policies.yaml | Policy rules and gates |

## Architecture Rigor

### Layer Alignment
- **L0 Routing:** ExecutionAdapter integrates with routing
- **L1 Cognition:** ResearchRequest/Result as reasoning contracts
- **L2 Execution:** Validators enforce execution policy
- **L3 Orchestration:** Research/Section/Source hierarchy
- **L4 State:** ResearchRunSummary with provenance

### Key Design Principles

1. **Zero Silent Failures:** All results include gate_violations list
2. **Evidence-Based:** Every section carries sources
3. **Deterministic:** Quality scoring is reproducible
4. **Bounded:** All numeric fields have min/max constraints (Pydantic Field)
5. **Traceable:** trace_id propagated through all artifacts

## Test Coverage

| Test File | Tests | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| test_research_types.py | 13 | ✅ Pass |
| test_integrations.py | 7 | ✅ Pass |
| test_outputs.py | 10 | ✅ Pass |

**Total:** 30/30 tests passing (100%)

## Production Readiness

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Type Safety | ✅ Pydantic validators with bounds |
| Error Handling | ✅ Explicit gate violations |
| Observability | ✅ Adapter integration |
| Configurability | ✅ YAML configs |
| Documentation | ✅ This review |
| Test Coverage | ✅ 100% pass |
