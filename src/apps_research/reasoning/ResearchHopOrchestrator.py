"""ResearchHopOrchestrator — shared-substrate entry for apps_research.

Alternative to the imperative ``BaseResearchEngine``-driven path. Uses
the shared ``HopPipelineExecutor`` to walk the 3 stages declared in
``apps_research/config/hop_pipeline.py``.

Both paths are supported:
- ``BaseResearchEngine`` subclasses + ``integrations/execution_adapter.py``
  — primary, imperative, matches the existing integration surface.
- ``ResearchHopOrchestrator.run(context) -> HopRunRecord`` — shared
  substrate, declarative, supports replay and composability.

See plan docs/archive/windsurf/legacy-tree/plans/apps-hop-substrate-four-apps-b4a2c9.md (Wave 1).
