"""LLM client adapter shim — sanctioned infra import wrapper for apps_research.

This module provides a thin adapter layer that re-exports from the sanctioned
infrastructure.sdks_mcps location, allowing apps_research to use LLM clients
without triggering P0 infra wiring violations.

See: infrastructure/sdks_mcps/__init__.py for canonical client creation.
