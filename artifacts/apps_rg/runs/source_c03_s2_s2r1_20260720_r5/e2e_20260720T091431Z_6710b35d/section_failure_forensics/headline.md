# Section Failure Forensics - headline

- failure_type: `upstream_cascade`
- baseline_confidence: `pinned_baseline_unavailable`
- failed_gate_ids: `-`

## Layperson Explanation

No prior passing same-scenario run was available, so this report does not claim a before-versus-after recovery result.
The runs first differ at ingestion: the prior run used NOT_OBSERVED, while the current run used C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH-worktrees\codex-apps-rg-source-refreeze\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\source_c03_s2_s2r1_20260720_r5\e2e_20260720T091431Z_6710b35d\apps_research\runs\r-5682110b42f68916f5f2fa80\briefing.md; later targeting, fact-selection, and provider-request evidence also changed, so the initial text difference cannot be attributed to the code revision alone.
The current run then made 0 pre-judge repair attempt(s), but the recorded defects were not cleared; it reverted to its first candidate, the final deterministic check still failed (failed gates not recorded), so EVIDENCE_NOT_RECORDED and the resume remained blocked.

## First Divergence And Underlying Cause

- First observed divergence: `u0_ingress` - The runs differ here, but the available artifacts do not prove this targeting change caused the failed sentence shape.
- First causally relevant divergence: `NOT_ISOLATED` - -
- Code cause status: `NOT_APPLICABLE_NO_PRIOR_BASELINE`

## Why It Passed Before

The pinned prior-pass baseline was unavailable, so this RCA cannot claim a clean passing comparison.

## Why It Failed Now

This section did not independently certify because an upstream dependency or pre-run blocker prevented normal section authorization: Pre-run dependency blocked execution: PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; pre_run_blocked:PHASE1_PRIOR_LANE_FAILED|missing_pointer:no resolvable run_dir pointer for lane 'headline' under C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH-worktrees\codex-apps-rg-source-refreeze\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\source_c03_s2_s2r1_20260720_r5\e2e_20260720T091431Z_6710b35d\modular_r4\sections.

## Prior Working Revision Comparison

| Signal | Prior passing revision | Current failure |
|---|---|---|
| Revision | `PR #None` / `NOT_OBSERVED` | `1375bf16a4d7774481aceb5594b7b7b924362e01` |
| Materialized output | `NOT_OBSERVED` / `NOT_OBSERVED` | `NOT_OBSERVED` / `NOT_OBSERVED` |
| X2 / X3 | `NOT_OBSERVED` / `NOT_OBSERVED` | `UNKNOWN` / `PRE_RUN:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR` |
| Judges | `NOT_OBSERVED` | `NOT_OBSERVED` |

## Required Fix

- Resolve the upstream blocker before dispatching `headline`.
- Write the upstream dependency status into the section pre-run receipt.
- Keep the section blocked until its own X1-X3 inputs are present.

## Artifact Hash Comparisons

- input_hash_comparison: `False`
- selected_fact_plan_comparison: `False`
- provider_request_hash_comparison: `False`
- materialized_output_hash_comparison: `False`
- comparison_complete: `False`
