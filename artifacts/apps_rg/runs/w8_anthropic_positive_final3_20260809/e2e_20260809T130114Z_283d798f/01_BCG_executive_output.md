## Executive Answer

The run is blocked and must not authorize a final resume. Required generation and/or final product gates did not clear. The source X3 decision was X3A_DENY_REROUTE, but completion ended BLOCKED because L2_EXECUTION_ERROR:RuntimeError:FAILED_MODULAR_R4: decisive='FAIL' failure='fatal_lane_recipe_policy:competencies:EXECUTED_X3A_DENY_REROUTE; unify_bullets:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; ibm_bullets:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; insurtech_bullets:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; ey_bullets:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; unify_narrative:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; ibm_narrative:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR; insurtech_narrative:PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR' schema_ok=False lane_ok=False. Use the P0/P1/PX recommendations below as the repair order.

## P0/P1/PX Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Evidence | Gate / Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P0` | Fix competencies first-lane execution failure before scheduling downstream lanes. | `PRE_RUN:EXECUTED_X3A_DENY_REROUTE` | No downstream lane without upstream authorization. |
| `P0` | Fix final_resume_aggregation before authorizing the final resume. | `final_resume_aggregation: x2=UNKNOWN; product=UNKNOWN; x3=X3_REVIEW_AGGREGATION` | Outcome remains blocked until full-resume aggregation clears X2/product gates. |
| `P0` | Keep final resume product gate failed while generated-section gap markers exist. | `final_resume_no_gap_markers` | Final resume unauthorized. |
| `P1` | Add dependency-token reporting for every PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR lane. | `PHASE1_NO_RUN_DIR lanes: unify_bullets, ibm_bullets, insurtech_bullets, ey_bullets, unify_narrative, ibm_narrative, insurtech_narrative, ey_narrative, executive_summary, headline` | Show exact upstream repair order. |

## Issue Tree

- `competencies`: Pre-run dependency blocked execution: EXECUTED_X3A_DENY_REROUTE; dispatch_error:L2_EXECUTION_ERROR:OSError:[Errno 22] Invalid argument
  - Root cause: The lane dependency graph allows a downstream lane to be scheduled without an explicit upstream product-authorization token.

    - `Retry / repair policy` / `NO_RECOVERY` / `10%`: No model retry can create the missing upstream authorization token. Evidence: `integrated_lane_pre_run_failure.json`. Required work: Route retries to the upstream blocked lane, not the dependent lane.
    - `Observability / RCA reporting` / `REPORTING_GAP` / `10%`: The operator output must name the upstream blocker, artifact, and lane token that is missing. Evidence: `integrated_lane_pre_run_failure.json`. Required work: Surface upstream lane, missing token, and repair order in the RCA.
  - Required implementation plan:
    - Represent the upstream lane's product authorization as an explicit dependency token consumed by the downstream lane.
    - Write the upstream blocker lane, gate, and artifact path into the pre-run failure receipt when dependency authorization is absent.
    - Update rerun orchestration so upstream repair lanes execute and certify before dependent lanes are scheduled.

  - Evidence: `forensics_complete=True`
  - Causal allocation:
    - Dominant cause: A downstream lane was evaluated without an upstream product-authorization token.

## Layperson Retry And Root-Cause Explanation

### competencies

No prior passing same-scenario run was available, so this report does not claim a before-versus-after recovery result.

The runs first differ at ingestion: the prior run used NOT_OBSERVED, while the current run used C:\Git\apps_rg_v2-worktrees\codex-e2e-defect-remediation-w0\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\w8_anthropic_positive_final3_20260809\e2e_20260809T130114Z_283d798f\apps_research\runs\r-a567938cd6c8d11f09a0f25b\briefing.md; later targeting, fact-selection, and provider-request evidence also changed, so the initial text difference cannot be attributed to the code revision alone.

The current run then made 0 pre-judge repair attempt(s), but the recorded defects were not cleared; it reverted to its first candidate, the final deterministic check still failed (failed gates not recorded), so EVIDENCE_NOT_RECORDED and the resume remained blocked.

### final_resume_aggregation

Every required section reached X3_ALLOW, so the current run assembled a complete resume candidate and advanced it to the whole-resume coherence panel.

The aggregate panel ran and recorded - EVIDENCE_NOT_RECORDED; the required two-of-two model-backed quorum was not met.

The controlling product defect is aggregate coherence, not upstream section eligibility: the failed aggregate gate is recorded in the final-resume review artifact.

- First observed divergence: `u0_ingress`
- First causally relevant divergence: `aggregate_coherence_quorum`
- Code cause status: `AGGREGATE_GATE_ISOLATED`


## Recommended Next Move

1. Resolve P0: Fix competencies first-lane execution failure before scheduling downstream lanes. Evidence: PRE_RUN:EXECUTED_X3A_DENY_REROUTE.
2. Resolve the remaining 2 P0 row(s) before rerun.
3. Rerun the integrated apps_rg path only after the listed P0 evidence clears.
4. Treat final assembly as valid only when every required section and product output is product-authorized.
