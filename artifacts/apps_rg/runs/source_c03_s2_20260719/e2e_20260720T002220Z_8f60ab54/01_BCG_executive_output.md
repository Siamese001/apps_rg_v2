# BCG Executive Output - apps_rg Run

Generated: `2026-07-20T00:22:20Z`
Run root: `@C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH-worktrees\codex-apps-rg-source-refreeze\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\source_c03_s2_20260719\e2e_20260720T002220Z_8f60ab54`

## Executive Answer

The run is blocked and must not authorize a final resume. Required generation and/or final product gates did not clear. The source X3 decision was PRE_RUN:PREFLIGHT, but completion ended BLOCKED because APPS_RG_ROUTE_SIGNING_CONFIGURATION_REQUIRED. Use the P0/P1/PX recommendations below as the repair order.

## P0/P1/PX Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Evidence | Gate / Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P0` | Restore the missing external preflight configuration before starting a new E2E run. | `Required route-signing configuration was absent at process ingestion, so the run could not create signed L0 route evidence.` | Blocked at PREFLIGHT before research, generation, judges, and final assembly. |
| `P1` | Keep the canonical preflight RCA and zero-retry accounting mandatory on every blocked run. | `{'prior_retry_count': 0, 'current_retry_count': 0, 'why_retries_did_not_run': 'Every judge or generation retry would reuse the same missing environment configuration and would fail before those systems were reached.'}` | Do not replace the recorded failure with a bare launcher exception or post-run backfill. |

## Board-Level Readout

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Did apps_research run? | `No` |
| Research source class | `NOT_OBSERVED` |
| Research input used | `NOT_OBSERVED` |
| Briefing evidence | `auto_research_internal=None; research_delegation_executed=NOT_OBSERVED; source=NOT_OBSERVED; briefing missing` |
| Did resume generation run? | `0 REAL_LLM section(s)` |
| Source X3 decision | `PRE_RUN:PREFLIGHT` |
| Completion status | `BLOCKED` |
| Completion fault | `APPS_RG_ROUTE_SIGNING_CONFIGURATION_REQUIRED` |
| Final product authorized? | `False` |
| Primary blocker | `Restore the missing external preflight configuration before starting a new E2E run. Evidence: Required route-signing configuration was absent at process ingestion, so the run could not create signed L0 route evidence.` |
| Decision | `Do not authorize; fix P0 gates first.` |

## Issue Tree

- `run_preflight`: Route-signing configuration ingestion failure
  - Root cause: Required route-signing configuration was absent at process ingestion, so the run could not create signed L0 route evidence.
  - Evidence: `C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH-worktrees\codex-apps-rg-source-refreeze\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\source_c03_s2_20260719\e2e_20260720T002220Z_8f60ab54\e2e_preflight_receipt.json`
  - Causal allocation:
    - Dominant cause: Required route-signing configuration was absent at process ingestion, so the run could not create signed L0 route evidence.
    - Retry recoverability: `NONE_WITHIN_CURRENT_PROCESS` - Every judge or generation retry would reuse the same missing environment configuration and would fail before those systems were reached.
    - `External configuration ingestion` / `ROOT_CAUSE` / `100%`: The launcher process did not receive both required route-signing environment variables before canonical E2E preflight. Evidence: `C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH-worktrees\codex-apps-rg-source-refreeze\artifacts\apps_rg\runs\source_c03_s2_20260719\e2e_20260720T002220Z_8f60ab54\e2e_preflight_receipt.json`. Required work: Inject the secret and key identifier through the approved local environment boundary without persisting or printing the secret.
  - Required implementation plan:
    - Provision the route-signing secret and its non-secret key identifier in the launcher process environment.
    - Keep signing readiness as the first hash-chained E2E stage before research or provider dispatch.
    - Emit and validate the operational RCA, prior-pass bisect, retry accounting, BCG, and L7 output before returning nonzero.
    - Retain regression coverage proving blocked preflight performs zero research, generation, and judge calls and never writes a secret value.

## Recommended Next Move

1. Resolve P0: Restore the missing external preflight configuration before starting a new E2E run. Evidence: Required route-signing configuration was absent at process ingestion, so the run could not create signed L0 route evidence..
2. Rerun the integrated apps_rg path only after the listed P0 evidence clears.
3. Treat final assembly as valid only when every required section and product output is product-authorized.
