# apps_rg Output Bisect

## Section: whole_run

### Layperson RCA

No prior passing same-scenario run was available, so this report does not claim a before-versus-after recovery result.

The runs first differ at ingestion: the prior run used NOT_OBSERVED, while the current run used C:\Git\apps_rg_v2\artifacts\apps_rg\runtime_proofs\full_resume_1bf5a3fd73c8\apps_research\runs\bridge_rg_research_bridge_8f31bdc3_16c695ab-f4b4-4844-9e5c-da107f73a430\briefing.md; later targeting, fact-selection, and provider-request evidence also changed, so the initial text difference cannot be attributed to the code revision alone.

The current run then made 0 pre-judge repair attempt(s), but the recorded defects were not cleared; it reverted to its first candidate, the final deterministic check still failed (failed gates not recorded), so the judges were not reached and the resume remained blocked.

### Divergence And Root Cause

- First observed divergence: `u0_ingress` - The runs differ here, but the available artifacts do not prove this targeting change caused the failed sentence shape.
- First causally relevant divergence: `NOT_ISOLATED` - -
- Code cause status: `NOT_APPLICABLE_NO_PRIOR_BASELINE`

### Underlying Root Cause

- `downstream_root_cause` / `ISOLATED_TO_UPSTREAM_SECTION`: This section was blocked downstream of the executive-summary product-authorization failure.
