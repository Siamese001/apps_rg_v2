"""Regression tests for HardenedAnthropicExecutor client setup.

Tests lock in the fix for the original null-client bug:
  - Before: _setup_client set self._client = None, so _completion()'s
    self._client.messages.create(...) would raise AttributeError at first call.
  - After: _setup_client instantiates anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=...) when
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is present, and logs a warning when absent.

The suite has two tiers:

1. *Source-level* regression tests (robust to future import-cascade regressions)
2. *Functional* regression tests that actually import and instantiate the
   executor, exercising the end-to-end construction path that EX1+EX2 unblocked
   (agentic_core package re-export of get_clock, apps_rg bootstrap_runtime
   _ensure_module real-import preference, hardening_mixin lazy-import helpers).
