"""Contract tests for X1D judge packet coherence and provider transport parity.

These would have caught the Brown & Brown Claude-only soft-fail (runs 001344/014222/005722):
same packet, X2 all PASS, Gemini/OpenAI PASS, Claude FAIL ~2.8.

Tests assert zero violations from audit_* helpers — they FAIL on current code until
exec-summary-x1d-transport-parity-d8f2a1 plan lands.
