"""W9 — anti-overfit detector hook on apps_rg orchestrator.

Tests `ResumeOrchestratorEngine._run_anti_overfit_check` directly so we don't
depend on the full orchestrator execution path. Three cases:

  * clean resume + clean JD              -> warning=False, escalate=False
  * resume with fabricated past claims   -> escalate=True
  * resume tailored heavily to JD        -> not escalated (mimicry alone is
                                            below hard-floor; warns only if
                                            aggregate score >= 2.0)
